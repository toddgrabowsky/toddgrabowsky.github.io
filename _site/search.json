    "text": "👋 Hi there.\nI’m a data scientist who loves building things—whether it’s software, woodworking projects, or community with other humans. I’m happiest when there’s a messy problem to untangle. I started my career developing AI systems for the DoD and Intelligence Community and now bring that experience to the legal industry.\nI’m currently the Technology Lead for DLA Piper’s AI Innovation team, where I lead a team of engineers building an AI-powered legal platform. I’m focused on using AI to turn unstructured text into clean, structured outputs and validating the results so they’re reliable, accurate, and actually useful."
